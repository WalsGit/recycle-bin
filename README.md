A [Flarum](http://flarum.org) extension to manage deleted (hidden) discussions.

## Still in development (no release yet) version-0.1.0
### ✅ In this first version you can:
- list all hidden discussions
- restore a hidden discussion (unhide)
- forever delete a hidden discussion (remove from db)
- Mass restore & delete (forever) discussions

### 🐞 Still to fix:
- ~~After restoring or deleting a discussion, the list doesn't update/refresh~~
- Use Stream to update the list after mass restoring or deleting discussions (only works with signle restoring or deleting buttons)
- Use Stream to update the total number of hidden discussions
- Search filter only works with complete words (returns a empty list for partial words) and isn't limited to discussion titles
- ~~Incorrect total number of pages and pagination doesn't work properly~~
- ~~Fix the position of the search filter and the total number of hidden discussions info~~.

### 🔲 Still to implement:
- ~~Mass restoring & deletion functionality~~
- Check permissions

### Notes
- Extention settings page based on the core UserListPage.tsx (Users settings page).
- Developped this with the help of AI (mainly ChatGPT, Cody & Gemini)
